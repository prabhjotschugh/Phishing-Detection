# Phishing Detection with MLP 🕵
This repository contains code for a phishing detection system using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implemented in PyTorch. Phishing is a prevalent form of cybercrime where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information by posing as trustworthy entities. This project aims to automatically classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing based on various features extracted from the URLs.

# Key Features:

📊 **Dataset Exploration:** Explore URL features and visualize distributions.

🧠 **Model Architecture:** MLP with ReLU, dropout, and batch normalization.

🚀 **Training:** Train the model using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

🔍 **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance with precision, recall, and F1 score.
